Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for the DriverPass project was Liam, the CEO of the company. The system that Liam wanted me to design was a web portal for students learning with DriverPass. The web portal would allow students to make accounts, take practice exams with current data from the DMV, and schedule driving lessons with instructors. It also allows instructors to leave notes on past lessons.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe that I did a good job of comprehensively determining the business requirements for the DriverPass system. While a lot of requirements may seem like boilerplate components for any similar system, they are still important to consider when distilling the customer's desired product down into actionable pieces to be developed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One part of my work that I would revise is the Gantt chart detailing the development schedule for the project. I would like to obtain more information regarding prerequisites for different steps in development, and figure out a time scale that still allows the team to see what pieces will take longer than others while not squeezing shorter time intervals into unreadable motes.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I broke the user's needs down by identifying each user's needs and the ways they interact with the system. By identifying the actors and their required interactions with the DriverPass system, it becomes much easier to determine which use cases have been satisfied and which of them still needs to be implemented.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I prefer to collect all of the requirements and disassemble them into component pieces. Then, I go over the requirements to determine how each of the components interact with each other, and what those interactions should look like for the system to function as expected.
